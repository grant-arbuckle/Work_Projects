### These are the Python programs I have written for work.
#### Our company receives a lot of its data from our sister company, which very few people from our company have the ability to query/access without restrictions. I wrote many of these programs to manipulate the data as it comes from our partner company into more meaningful and useable formats for our finance and accounting teams as our company has evolved in recent years. This saved our company lots of money we would have spent paying our partner to reprogram the reports, and enabled our partner to use their time more productively that would have otherwise been spent on reprogramming several of our reports.
