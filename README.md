### These are the Python programs and Jupyter Notebooks I have written and used in my current role.
#### Our company receives a lot of its data from our sister company, which very few people from our company have the ability to query/access without restrictions. I wrote many of these programs to manipulate the data as it comes from our partner company into more meaningful and useable formats for our finance and accounting teams as our company has evolved in recent years. This saved our company money we would have spent paying our partner to reprogram the reports, and enabled our partner to use their time more productively that would have otherwise been spent on reprogramming these reports.

#### The "DM3030" programs take the report data conversions a few steps further; I built these to consolidate daily PDF files into one PDF, extract and clean data from the PDF, then perform calculations that were otherwise done by accounting. We use the final output as a balancing tool to verify the accuracy of one of our accounting processes (namely our Daily Revenue Report), which takes about a minute to do now thanks to Python.
