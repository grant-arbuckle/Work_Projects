# Report Pull Automation Application with GUI
#### This folder contains the code I used to build an application with a GUI to automate the download and movement of ~830 reports that the company was previously doing manually each month-end close period. I utilized Selenium to automate the navigation to and download of reports, and PySimpleGUI to create a GUI to make the process super easy for end users. I also used PSGCompiler to package up the Python code into an executable, so there are no dependencies or installs needed by end users, and the report pulling automation can be scheduled each month. See an example of the GUI in action in the "GUI Example" file.
